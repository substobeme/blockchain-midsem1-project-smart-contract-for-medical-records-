# Introduction
Smart contracts have changed how healthcare records are handled by using blockchain technology. These contracts are like self-running programs that make it safe and easy to store and access important medical information. Patients can control who sees their health data, protecting their privacy. Doctors find it easier to record diagnoses and treatments, reducing paperwork. Hospitals can store and share patient records securely, which helps them work together better for patients. Blockchain keeps records safe from tampering. This technology has improved how healthcare data is managed, making it safer and more efficient while giving patients more control over their records. 
# Project Overview
This project aims to be a user-friendly and secure healthcare data management system that utilizes smart contracts and integrates with the Metamask wallet. It allows for the collection and storage of essential patient, doctor, and hospital information in a reliable and tamper-proof manner. Users can easily input their data into the system, which ensures data security through blockchain technology. When needed, information can be efficiently retrieved and displayed, simplifying healthcare record management for patients, doctors, and hospitals alike. It offers a convenient and trustworthy solution for healthcare data management in the digital age.</br>
The <b>techstack</b> of this project involves:

<b>Blockchain and Smart Contracts:</b><br/>
Ethereum: The blockchain platform used for deploying smart contracts.</br>
Smart Contracts(using Solidity): These contracts manage the storage and retrieval of patient, doctor, and hospital information securely on the blockchain.</br>
ERC721 Token Standard: The smart contract extends the ERC721 standard from the OpenZeppelin library, which leads to creation of unique tokens representing medical records, doctors, hospitals, and patients.

<b>Web Development:</b></br>
HTML: The standard markup language for creating the web interface(UI).</br>
JavaScript (Web3.js): JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts.</br>
MetaMask: A browser extension used for Ethereum wallet management and blockchain interaction.

# Advantage over traditional approach
This project deviates from the tradition centralized database approach of storing and retrieving data by integrating smart contracts in accomplishing the set goal. </br>
This is because of the following advantages:</br>
<b>1.Immutable and Secure:</b> Smart contracts on the blockchain make data almost impossible to change or delete, ensuring that important medical records remain trustworthy.

<b>2.Better Security:</b> Blockchain technology uses strong encryption and security methods, reducing the chances of data breaches and unauthorized access. Patients' private information is kept safer.

<b>3.Decentralization:</b> Data isn't kept on one central server; but is decentralized in nature. This makes it less likely for all the data to be lost or damaged due to a single point of failure.

<b>4.Detailed Record Keeping:</b> Smart contracts keep thorough records of any changes or access to data. This can be really useful for following rules and maintaining regulations related to data updation.


# Conclusion
In conclusion, using smart contracts for healthcare records has some big benefits. It ensures data integrity through immutability and enhances security, safeguarding patient privacy. Decentralization minimizes the risk of data loss due to single points of failure.It also makes things more efficient, reducing the need for lots of paperwork and saving money. And it keeps a detailed history of all the changes made to the records, which can be really helpful for following rules and maintaining regulations related to data updation. Overall, smart contracts in healthcare are a smart move for better, safer, and more efficient record-keeping in the healthcare industry.
