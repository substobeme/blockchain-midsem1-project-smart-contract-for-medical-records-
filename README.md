# Introduction
Smart contracts have been responsible for revolutionizing the way patient, doctor, and hospital records are managed in the healthcare industry. These self-executing nature of the contracts, built on blockchain technology, offer a secure and transparent means of storing and retrieving sensitive medical information.For patients, smart contracts enable them to have greater control over their health data, granting access only to authorized healthcare providers while maintaining data privacy. Doctors benefit from a streamlined and efficient system for recording patient diagnoses and treatments, reducing administrative overhead. Hospitals can securely store and share patient records across their network, ensuring seamless collaboration and improved patient care. The immutable nature of blockchain ensures the integrity and authenticity of medical records, reducing the risk of data tampering or loss.
# Project Overview
This project aims to be a user-friendly and secure healthcare data management system that utilizes smart contracts and integrates with the Metamask wallet. It allows for the collection and storage of essential patient, doctor, and hospital information in a reliable and tamper-proof manner. Users can easily input their data into the system, which ensures data security through blockchain technology. When needed, the project can efficiently retrieve and display this information, simplifying healthcare record management for patients, doctors, and hospitals alike. It offers a convenient and trustworthy solution for healthcare data management in the digital age.</br>
The <b>techstack</b> of this project involves:

<b>Blockchain and Smart Contracts:</b><br/>
Ethereum: The blockchain platform used for deploying smart contracts.</br>
Smart Contracts(using Solidity): These contracts manage the storage and retrieval of patient, doctor, and hospital information securely on the blockchain.

<b>Web Development:</b></br>
HTML: The markup language for creating the web interface(UI).</br>
JavaScript (Web3.js): JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts.</br>
MetaMask: A browser extension used for Ethereum wallet management and blockchain interaction.

# Advantage over traditional approach
This project deviates from the tradition centralized database approach of storing and retrieving data by integrating smart contracts in accomplishing the set goal. </br>
This is because of the following advantages:
<b>1.Immutable and Tamper-Proof:</b> Smart contracts on blockchain provide immutability, making it nearly impossible to alter or delete stored data. This is critical for maintaining the integrity of sensitive medical records.

<b> 2.Enhanced Security:</b> Blockchain technology employs robust encryption and cryptographic techniques, reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access. Patient confidentiality is better protected.

<b> 3.Decentralization:</b> Data is not stored on a central server but distributed across a network of nodes. This decentralization reduces the risk of a single point of failure, making data more resilient and available.

<b> 4.Reduced Administrative Overhead:</b> Smart contracts can automate administrative processes, reducing paperwork and manual data entry. This efficiency can lower operational costs for hospitals and clinics.

<b>  5.Audit Trails:</b> Smart contracts maintain detailed audit trails of data changes and access, providing a comprehensive history of each medical record. This can be valuable for compliance and legal purposes.
